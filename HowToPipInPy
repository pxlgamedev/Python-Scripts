import pip

from pip._internal import main as _main

## with godot-python "pip._internal" was not recognized, however using "pip.main" in the next step worked

package_names=['html2text'] #packages to install
_main(['install'] + package_names + ['--upgrade']) 

# pip.main(['install'] + package_names + ['--upgrade'])
